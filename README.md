# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
 Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Key features of Python:
Readability and simplicity: Easy to read and write, with a syntax that emphasizes readability.
Extensive standard library: Includes modules and packages for a wide range of tasks.
Interpreted language: Executes code line by line, which facilitates debugging and interactive testing.
Dynamic typing: Variables do not need explicit declarations, and their types are determined at runtime.
Cross-platform: Runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Community support: Large and active community with abundant resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries.

Use cases where Python is particularly effective:
Web development: Frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data analysis and visualization: Libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Machine learning and AI: Libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.
Automation and scripting: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Scientific computing: Tools like SciPy and SymPy.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

 Windows:
Download the installer from the Python website.
Run the installer and ensure the "Add Python to PATH" option is checked.
Click "Install Now" and follow the prompts.

Verify the installation:
python --version
# or
python3 --version

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

print("Hello, World!")

print: A built-in function that outputs text to the console.
"Hello, World!": A string literal enclosed in double quotes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
  
Basic data types:
int: Integer numbers, e.g., 1, 42
float: Floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, 2.718
str: String of characters, e.g., "hello", "Python"
bool: Boolean values, True or False
list: Ordered collection of elements, e.g., [1, 2, 3]
dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs, e.g., {"key": "value"}

# Integer
age = 30
print(age)

# Float
pi = 3.14159
print(pi)

# String
name = "Alice"
print(name)

# Boolean
is_student = True
print(is_student)

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(person)


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional statements execute a block of code based on a condition.

x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is non-positive")

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in numbers:
    print(number)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, reducing redundancy, and improving readability.

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Lists:
Ordered collection of elements.
Indexed by position.
Elements can be accessed using their index.

Dictionaries:
Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Indexed by keys.
Values can be accessed using their keys.

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

# Accessing an element in the list
print(numbers[2])  # Output: 3

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(person)

# Accessing a value in the dictionary
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice

# Adding a new key-value pair
person["city"] = "New York"
print(person)

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling in Python allows you to handle runtime errors gracefully.

try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    print("This will always execute")


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

Modules:
Modules are files containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that can be imported and used in other Python scripts.

Packages:
Packages are directories containing multiple modules. They include an __init__.py file to mark the directory as a package.

import math

# Using a function from the math module
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # Output: 4.0

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)


# Writing to a file
lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]

with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")



# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
